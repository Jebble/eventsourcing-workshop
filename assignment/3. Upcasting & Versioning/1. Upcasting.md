# Upcasting

1. Adding properties to events without upcasters 

A new requirement comes in, we want to display a description next to the transaction. For all transactions in the past, we can display "unknown" as the description. For all future transactions, we can display the description from the transaction.
Can you add this field to the events, and adjust the projectors, so they will display the description? You won't need to use any upcasters for this yet, you should be able to handle this in the event class itself.

There is already a migration in place for the transactions table, and the ui is already updated.
