# Introduction

In this series of small assignments we'll be creating an event sourced implementation of a Wallet.
All verified accounts have a wallet in our application. The wallet can be used do deposit and withdraw "tokens" from.

There are a few business requirements that we need to meet. Don't worry about them yet, as we'll introduce them one by one in the assignments. 

* Only verified accounts can have a wallet.
* When a wallet is created, it should have a balance of 0.
* When a user deposits tokens, the balance should increase.
* When a user withdraws tokens, the balance should decrease.
* Wallet balance can never go negative.
  * We want to know how often a user tries to withdraw more tokens than they have.
